Thank you for reading me.

IMPORTANT
- The mod LTV_Economy needs WrapUI to function properly. Please add both of these to your mods folder
- Certain aspects of the mod can be modified under LTV_Economy/data/config/
- The first day inside your first game might freeze up to a minute as the mod generates dynamic configs for any industries without an industry_config.json entry. This one-time operation should not happen again unless a mod with new industries gets added or the file dynamic_industry_config.json.data under saves/common/ gets deleted.
